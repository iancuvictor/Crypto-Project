# CryptoCurrency Project - React.JS
This is my first React.JS project that will be made entirely by me (Back end as well, not just the Front end) =)
Because I am a good guy, I deployed this project so you don't have to run it yourself on your PC. 

The project is made in:
- React.js
- Html, css, JS

It uses the [CoinRanking API](https://rapidapi.com/Coinranking/api/coinranking1/) to fetch the data.
