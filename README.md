# CryptoCurrency Project - React.JS
This is my first React.JS project that will be made entirely by me (Back end as well, not just the Front end) =)

This is the link to the deployed website: https://iancuvictor.github.io/Crypto-Project/ <br>
``(Note that it is still in production, so this project is still going through puberty)``

The code is wrote in:
- React.js
- Html, css, JS

It uses the [CoinRanking API](https://rapidapi.com/Coinranking/api/coinranking1/) to fetch the data.
